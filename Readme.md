# A simple app to save and show a list of people with age

Following TDD methodology build a full CRUD app in which you save new people, delete them,
show them all and update them.
Most of the functionalities are mostly filled for you as an example. To make the test work 
and pass follow the instructions described in the file

There are 2 conditions on the user data:
1. Each user must have a name and it has to be unique to that user
2. Each user must provide his or her age, or else the user will not be saved in the system.
No other information except age and name can be saved within the application
